\begin{abstract}
Future experiments in high energy and nuclear physics may require
large, inexpensive calorimeters that can operate up to doses of 50~Mrad
or more. We present the results of a study of a scintillator tile
based on EJ-309 liquid scintillator using cosmic rays, test beam, and
$\rm{^{60}Co}$ irradiations that shows little degradation of output
under irradiation.

\section{Introduction}
Sampling calorimeters using plastic scintillator tiles with
wavelength-shifting (WLS) fibers, such as the CDF plug
calorimeter\cite{Aota1995557} and the CMS Barrel\cite{CMSHB} and
Endcap\cite{HCALTDR1997} hadron calorimeters, are popular due to their
low cost and ease of construction. Plastic scintillator is available
commercially from companies like St. Gobain and Eljen. When
irradiated, however, the performance of plastic scintillator and WLS
fibers deteriorate; light self-absorption (yellowing) increases and
light output decreases. The resulting loss of light output for this
kind of tile has been studied \cite{vasken,ByonWagner1993263}.
Generally, the light output decreases exponentially with dose, with an
decay constant on order of a few~ Mrad. Future high energy and nuclear
experiments, however, may have to operate in environments that will
deliver doses of tens of Mrad. In this paper, we present the design
and optimization of a liquid scintillator tile, based on EJ-309 liquid
scintillator, that can operate in this kind of environment.

\section{Tile design}
\label{sec:design}
Our tile is based on EJ-309 scintillator, from Eljen Technology, which
uses naphthalene as the substrate with wavelength shifting additives.
EJ-309 has a light output that is 75\% of anthracene, a wavelength of
maximum emission of 424~nm, a refractive index of 1.57, and a flash
point of $\rm{144^o}$C. The high flash point is important for its
suitability for a collider environment.

The design of a tile to hold the liquid needs to consider light
collection efficiency, light collection uniformity, and cost. The
container should not leak, and there should not be interactions
between the container and its contents that degrade the light output
over time or compromise the integrity of the
container. Figure~\ref{fig:tiledesign} shows the mechanical
construction of our prototype. The case is made of aluminum. Two
transparent support tubes with outer diameter of 2~mm run through the
liquid and can hold either wavelength shifting fiber or liquid
wavelength shifter. The index was measured at the Quattrone
Nanofabrication facility at the University of Pennsylvania to be
{\color{red} need jeff's number}. When a wavelength shifting fiber was
used, the end of the fiber not connected to the photodetector was
coated with Al to increase the light output unless otherwise
noted. The support tube is sealed to the case with a Viton
fluoroelastomer o-ring. The thickness of the top and bottom Aluminum
plates is 0.5~mm. The total internal volume is 88~mm x 88~mm x
4~mm. The inner surface of the container is a lapped and polished
Al-6061 available from McMaster Carr. The material comes with a
plastic coating that can be used to maintain its mirror quality during
the machining process and then removed before the welding step. The
liquid was transfered into the containing in an inert atmosphere.

Several variations on this design were constructed. For the default
design, the thickness of the liquid is 4~mm. A version with a 6~mm
thickness was also made. The support tubes were quartz with an inner
diameter of 1.3~mm and were used with Kuraray Y-11 fiber (doping of
200~ppm), double-clad. Quartz tubes filled with liquid wavelength
shifter were also used. The quartz tubes had an outer diameter of 2~mm
and an inner diameter of 1~mm (or an outer diameter of 1~mm and an
inner diameter of 0.4~mm) and a measured index of {\color{red} need
  jeff's number}. The liquid wavelength shifter was a prototype
material from Eljen, and is not yet a commercial item. The liquid
wavelength shifter has an emission maximum from between 481 and 492~nm
and a decay time between 2 and 8~ns. The solvent was the same as that
used for EJ-309. Sapphire tubes were also tested with both liquid and
plastic wavelength shifter.

In what follows, the results shown are for the mirrored tile with 4 mm
thickness, quartz support tubes, and a 0.9~mm diameter Y-11 WLS fiber
unless otherwise stated.

\section{Light yield and uniformity as measured in test beam}

The light yield and uniformity of the tiles was measured in the H2
test beam facility at CERN using 120~GeV muons. The trigger required
coincidence of two out of four plastic scintillator hodoscopes. The
effective beam cross sectional area, after trigger requirements, was
14x14~cm$^2$. The positions of the muons was measured with five
wire chambers. The position obtained from the counter closest to the
prototype was used. We also required the signal in each wire chamber
be consistent with that of a single muon, and that the difference in
positions in sequential chambers be consistent within uncertainties.
As many groups were using the same test beam, there was material
upstream of our counters. For some runs, several iron blocks were
used to support experiments upstream of our counters. Because the
muons were high energy, the probability of a muon-induced shower was
non-neglibile. (This was verified later at a test beam at FNAL that
had a cleaner beam line and through simulation.) We present here the
results from the runs and tiles with the smallest upstream material.

The wavelength shifting fiber was connected to a clear fiber using a
connector designed at FNAL. The clear fiber was lead away from the
beam line. The light output was measured using a Hamamatsu
R7600U-200-M4 photomultiplier tube and a custom ASIC that integrates
and digitizes the resulting charged, called the ``QIE''\cite{qie}.
The photomultiplier has a peak quantum efficiency of 40\% at a
wavelength of 400~nm and produces a clear single photoelectron (pe)
peak. The integrated charge is digitized every 25~ns. Ten
digitizations were recorded per muon trigger. The sum of the signal
in the ${\rm 4^{th}}$ to ${\rm 7^{th}}$ sample was used.

The average number of pe's produced per minimum ionizing particle
(mip) was estimated by doing a Gaussian fit to the peak centered on
the pedestal. The mean number of pe's was calculated using the
fraction of events in this peak, assuming a Poisson distribution. The
nominal tile produced 1.7~pe's per mip. Tiles for the CMS hadron
calorimeter typically produce 3~pe's per mip\cite{CMSHB}. The results
have a systematic uncertainty related to the handling of the events
with showering muons. We evaluate this uncertainty by looking at the
results after truncating the distribution at around 25~pe's (2500 adc
counts). The results were stable to within 5\%. In addition, runs
taken with varying amounts of material in front of our detector, from
several radiation lengths to a {\color{red} what was the upstream
 material for the best} resulted in a 15\% variation in light yield.
We therefore take a 16\% uncertainty due to upstream material.

The uniformity of the light collection was also studied at the CERN
test beam. Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} shows the fraction of events with at
least 1~pe versus the impact position of the mip along the axis
parallel to the support tubes (left) and perpendicular to the support
tubes (right). As expected, there is little dependence on the
coordinate parallel to the support tubes. The light yield does depend
on the perpendicular distance. The light collection efficiency is
maximum at for muons near the WLS fiber and is approximately 30\%
lower for muons in the center or edges of the tile. For most hadron
calorimetry applications, we verified through simulation that this
degree of nonuniformity would not aversely affect jet resolutions.

  one pe as a function of the impact position of the mip along the

\end{figure}

\section{Light yield dependence on tile parameters}

The dependence of the light yield on variations in the design
parameters was studied using cosmic ray data taken at the University
of Maryland. Scintillator-based counters above and below the tile
were used for triggers. The tile light output was measured using a
Hamamatsu R7600U-200-M4 photomultiplier tube. Fibers were connected
to the tube using optical glue. Data was collected with a Tektronix
MSO 5204 oscilloscope. No attempt was made to select minimum ionizing
muons. The muons thus are low energy and will produce more light than
those studied at the CERN test beam. We found an average of 
$2.88\pm 0.05$~pe for the nominal tile. A similar tile but without
the mirroring yielded $1.98\pm 0.03$~pe, a reduction of a factor of
1.45. A tile with a 6~mm thickness of liquid, non-mirrored, yielded
$2.61\pm 0.05$~pe, an increase over the 4~mm non-mirrored tile of a
factor of 1.32.

The light yield was also studied using a capillary quartz tube, filled
with liquid wavelength shifter, instead of a plastic WLS. The
capillary quartz tube had an outer diameter of 2~mm, and an inner
diameter of 0.6~mm.  The quartz support tube, which contained the
plastic WLS fibers, and created an air gap between the tube itself and
the fiber, was entirely replaced by the quartz capillary. In this
configuration, there is no air gap between the liquid scintillator and
the liquid wavelength shifter.  The two materials have a very similar
index of refraction (1.57), while the quartz capillary, with a lower
index of refraction, allows light to be captured within the liquid WLS
material. Figure~\ref{fig:y11_vs_cap} shows a comparison between the
plastic and liquid WLS configuration. The light collection efficiency
drops from $92\%$ to $45\%$, and the average light yield halves as
well. However, we shall note that the setup with a quartz capillary is
significant step towards a radiation-tolerant calorimetry cell. The
light output of the capillary setup has not been optimized as a
function of the index of refraction of the quartz capillary, thus
possibly leaving some space for improving the performance of the
capillary setup.

\caption{Comparison between the light output of a liquid scintillator
  tile equipped with a plastic WLS fiber, and a capillary filled with
  liquid WLS. The two distributions are normalized to have the same
  number of events in the pedestal.}
\label{fig:y11_vs_cap}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We also compared the performance of liquid-scintillator tiles produced
with different thickness, and different treatment of the aluminum
surface. In particular, we produced the following three variations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item thickness: 4~mm; mirrored aluminum surface
  \item thickness: 4~mm; non-mirrored aluminum surface
  \item thickness: 6~mm; non-mirrored aluminum surface
\end{enumerate}
Figure~\ref{fig:thickness_comp} shows a comparison among the three
tiles. The light output and efficiency were measured using cosmic-ray
data. The plots show that the best light output and efficiency is
obtained by mirroring the aluminum surface in contact with the liquid
scintillator. Increasing the container volume, within the construction
constraints of an hadronic calorimeter, also helps improving the
performance.

  three distributions are normalized to have the same number of events
  in the pedestal.}
\label{fig:thickness_comp}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Finally, we tested the performance of the same tile, 4mm-thick, with a
mirrored aluminum surface, as a function of the thickness of the
readout plastic WLS fiber. We tested three plastic fibers, with a
thickness of 0.5~mm, 0.9~mm, and 1~mm. We measured that the higher the
fiber thickness, the higher the efficiency and light output, as shown
in Figure~\ref{fig:fiber_thickness_comp}.

\end{figure}

\section{Radiation hardness tests}

Several different tests were made using irradiations with a
$\rm{^{60}Co}$ source coated at the University of Maryland.
Performance of the tile under irradiation in a proton-proton collision
environment will be the subject of a future paper.

The most striking test is the light-output and efficiency comparison
between two samples of liquid used in the same tile, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:ej309_irradiated}. A dark-glass vial containing 125~ml
of liquid scintillator had been irradiated with $\gamma$-rays up to a
dose of 50~Mrad, at a dose rate of 1~Mrad/hr.

Both the efficiency and light output from the two measurements are
consistent within the uncertainty, indicating that EJ-309 is
radiation-tolerant to $\gamma$-ray irradiations.

\end{center}
\end{figure}


\section{Comparison with simulation, and optimization}
We use the GEANT4~\cite{Agostinelli2003250} package to simulate the
optics of our tile. GEANT4's optical package includes simulations of
refraction, reflection, wave length shifting, and light attenuation.
A variety of options for the reflection are available. We used the
``Specular Spike'' option for the Al and an absorption length of 2~m for
the EJ-309. When simulating the WLS fiber, an air gap was included
between the fiber cladding and the support tube, while no such gap
exists for the simulation of the capillary. An index of refraction of
1.57 is used for the EJ-309. The index for sapphire used was 1.77.
For quartz, values between 1.46 and 1.55 were used. Photons are
generated at random positions inside the liquid volume, with a
wavelength corresponding to the emission maximum of EJ-309.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simeff} left, we find the simulation
reproduces the light collection nonuniformity when a reflectivity of
0.9 is used for the mirrored Al.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figures/geant_result_uniformity.png}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{./figures/geant_result_reflectivity.png}
\caption{(left) Ratio of light yield to maximum light yield from
  simulationed tile as a function of the distance perpedicular to the
  support tubes. {\color{red} figure is place holder until Zishuo
    gives right one} (right) Light collection efficiency vs Aluminum
  reflectivity {\color{red} Zishuo can you make this a ratio plot?
    pick some point and divide the rest by it?} }
\label{fig:simeff}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We find that the light collection efficiency is a strong function of
the reflectivity of the Al (Figure ~\ref{fig:simeff} right).

We find the best light collection comes when the support tube has the
lowest possible index of refraction for liquid WLS. The opposite is
true for a fiber with an air gap (and plastic WLS). For a 1mm
diameter for the WLS, the light collection efficiency increase by a
factor of {\color{red} Zishuo please add this number} going from an
index of 1.55 to 1.46 for liquids. Presumably this difference would
decrease as the reflectivity of the Al increases. For a fiber with an
air gap, the efficiency decreases by a factor of {\color{red} Zishuo
 please add this number} going from an index of 1.77 to 1.46.

\section{Conclusions}

We presented results for a liquid scintillating tile using wavelength
shifting fiber readout. For our nominal design, $1.7\pm 0.2$~pe's
were produced for minimum ionizing particles.
